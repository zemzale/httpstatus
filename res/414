      414
      Request-URI Too Long
The server is refusing to service the request because the request-target<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup> is longer than the server is willing to interpret.

This rare condition is only likely to occur when a client has improperly converted a POST request to a GET request with long query information, when the client has descended into a &quot;black hole&quot; of redirection (e.g., a redirected URI prefix that points to a suffix of itself) or when the server is under attack by a client attempting to exploit potential security holes.

A 414 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls <sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>.
