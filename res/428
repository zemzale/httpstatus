      <h1><span>428</span> Precondition Required</h1><p>The origin server requires the request to be conditional.</p>
<p>Its typical use is to avoid the &quot;lost update&quot; problem, where a client GETs a resource&#39;s state, modifies it, and PUTs it back to the server, when meanwhile a third party has modified the state on the server, leading to a conflict. By requiring requests to be conditional, the server can assure that clients are working with the correct copies.</p>
<p>Responses using this status code SHOULD explain how to resubmit the request successfully. For example:</p>
<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 428 Precondition Required
Content-Type: text/html

&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Precondition Required&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Precondition Required&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This request is required to be conditional; try using &quot;If-Match&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre><p>Responses with the 428 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.</p>
