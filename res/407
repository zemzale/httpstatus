{
    Code:407,
Name:"Proxy Authentication Required",
Description:`

Similar to <a href="/401">401 Unauthorized</a>, but it indicates that the client needs to authenticate itself in order to use a proxy.

The proxy MUST send a Proxy-Authenticate header field<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup> containing a challenge applicable to that proxy for the target resource. The client MAY repeat the request with a new or replaced Proxy-Authorization header field<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>.
