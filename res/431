      <h1><span>431</span> Request Header Fields Too Large</h1><p>The server is unwilling to process the request because its header fields are too large. The request MAY be resubmitted after reducing the size of the request header fields.</p>
<p>It can be used both when the set of request header fields in total is too large, and when a single header field is at fault.  In the latter case, the response representation SHOULD specify which header field was too large.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 431 Request Header Fields Too Large
Content-Type: text/html

&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Request Header Fields Too Large&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Request Header Fields Too Large&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &quot;Example&quot; header was too large.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre><p>Responses with the 431 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.</p>
