Payload Too Large

The server is refusing to process a request because the request payload is larger than the server is willing or able to process.

The server MAY close the connection to prevent the client from continuing the request.

If the condition is temporary, the server SHOULD generate a Retry-After header field to indicate that it is temporary and after what time the client MAY try again.
