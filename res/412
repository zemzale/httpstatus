      <h2>4&times;&times; Client Error</h2>
      <h1><span>412</span> Precondition Failed</h1><p>One or more conditions given in the request header fields evaluated to false when tested on the server.</p>
<p>This response code allows the client to place preconditions on the current resource state (its current representations and metadata) and, thus, prevent the request method from being applied if the target resource is in an unexpected state.</p>
