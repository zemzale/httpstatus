      <h1><span>102</span> Processing</h1><p>An interim response used to inform the client that the server has accepted the complete request, but has not yet completed it.</p>
<p>This status code SHOULD only be sent when the server has a reasonable expectation that the request will take significant time to complete. As guidance, if a method is taking longer than 20 seconds (a reasonable, but arbitrary value) to process the server SHOULD return a 102 (Processing) response. The server MUST send a final response after the request has been completed.</p>
<p>Methods can potentially take a long period of time to process, especially methods that support the Depth header. In such cases the client may time-out the connection while waiting for a response. To prevent this the server may return a 102 Processing status code to indicate to the client that the server is still processing the method.</p>
