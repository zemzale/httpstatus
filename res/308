{
    Code:308,
Name:"Permanent Redirect",
Description:`

The target resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource ought to use one of the enclosed URIs.

Clients with link editing capabilities ought to automatically re-link references to the effective request URI<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup> to one or more of the new references sent by the server, where possible.

The server SHOULD generate a Location header field<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup> in the response containing a preferred URI reference for the new permanent URI. The user agent MAY use the Location field value for automatic redirection. The server&#39;s response payload usually contains a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s).

A 308 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls<sup><a href="#ref-3">3</a></sup>.

Note: This status code is similar to <a href="/301">301 Moved Permanently</a>, except that it does not allow changing the request method from POST to GET.
