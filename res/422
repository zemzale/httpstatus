422
Unprocessable Entity

The server understands the content type of the request entity (hence a <a href="/415">415 Unsupported Media Type</a> status code is inappropriate), and the syntax of the request entity is correct (thus a <a href="/400">400 Bad Request</a> status code is inappropriate) but was unable to process the contained instructions.

For example, this error condition may occur if an XML request body contains well-formed (i.e., syntactically correct), but semantically erroneous, XML instructions.
