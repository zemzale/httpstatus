<p>Clients receiving a 421 Misdirected Request response from a server MAY retry the request -- whether the request method is idempotent or not -- over a different connection. This is possible if a connection is reused<sup><a href="#ref-1">1</a></sup>or if an alternative service is selected <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#ref-ALT-SVC">ALT-SVC</a>.</p>
<p>This status code MUST NOT be generated by proxies.</p>
<p>A 421 response is cacheable by default, i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls<sup><a href="#ref-2">2</a></sup>.</p>
